# Restaurants Search Api

This exercise was taken from The Complete React Native + Hooks Course [2020] - Udemy

In this exercise the user is able to search for any kind of food he/she desires, the app will show a list of restaurants that serves that specific food the user is looking for. At the moment the region is hardcoded to display only Dublinâ€™s restaurants.

The app uses Yelp Api and it gives the user a list with the best Cost Effective, Bit Pricier and Big spender, it also displays how many starts the restaurant have and the amount of comments. 

The user is able to click on the restaurant picture where it will redirect the user to another screen where he/she will be able to see more images of the restaurant.
